## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- Rebranded remaining `OpenCharts` references to `Xee.Labs` across
  `public/manifest.json` (PWA name/short_name), the loading screen text and
  doc comments in `App.tsx`, `services/api.ts`, `services/ws.ts`,

  and `README.md`.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- Rebranded `index.html` (title, meta tags) from `OpenCharts` to `Xee.Labs`.

- Footer version badge now reads from `package.json` instead of a
  hardcoded string, so it stays in sync with the release version.

### Added
- Initial stable release, tagged from the terminal-migration merge.
- Footer component displaying "Xee.Labs" branding with a version badge.
